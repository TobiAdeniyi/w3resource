"4. Write a Python program to calculate the area of a parallelogram."

# Note: A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel (and therefore opposite angles equal).
# A quadrilateral with equal sides is called a rhombus, and a parallelogram whose angles are all right angles is called a rectangle.


h = float(input("Enter vertical hight:"))
x = float(input("Enter horizontal width:"))

area = h * x

print(f"This parallelogram has a area of {area}")
