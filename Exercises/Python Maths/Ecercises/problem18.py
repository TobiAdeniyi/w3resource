"""18. Write a Python program to computing square roots using the Babylonian method."""

# Perhaps the first algorithm used for approximating âˆšS is known as the Babylonian method,
# named after the Babylonians, or "Hero's method", named after the first-century Greek
# mathematician Hero of Alexandria who gave the first explicit description of the method.
# It can be derived from (but predates by 16 centuries) Newton's method.
# The basic idea is that if x is an overestimate to the square root of a non-negative real
# number S then S / x will be an underestimate and so the average of these two numbers may
# reasonably be expected to provide a better approximation.
